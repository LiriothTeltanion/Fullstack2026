## 🧭 NOVA Folder Guide

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Readiness | **80%** |
| Files | 4 |
| Source files | 1 |
| Test files | 0 |
| Text lines | 156 |

### ▶️ Main paths

- `Week6DatabasesAndNodejs/Day2DatabaseConcepts1/Exercises/ExercisesXP/xp_sql_answers.sql`

### 🚀 Run

```bash
psql -f Week6DatabasesAndNodejs/Day2DatabaseConcepts1/Exercises/ExercisesXP/xp_sql_answers.sql
```

### 🟢 What is already strong

- ✅ README documentation is generated and repeatable.
- ✅ Contains 1 source file(s) across practical exercises or projects.
- ✅ No Python syntax error was detected in this folder tree.
- ✅ A likely runnable entry point was detected.

### 🟠 What to improve next

- ⚠️ No local unit test is present yet; repository-wide syntax checks still cover the sources.

### 🧪 Validation

```bash
python tools/nova_quality_gate.py --repo . --strict
python -m unittest discover -s tests/python -p "test_*.py" -v
node tools/run_node_tests.mjs .
```

> The readiness value is a transparent repository heuristic, not a course grade and not proof that every interactive or external-API exercise was executed.
