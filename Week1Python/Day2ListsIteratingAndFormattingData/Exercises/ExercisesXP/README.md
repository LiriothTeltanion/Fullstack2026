### ▶️ Main paths

- `Week1Python/Day2ListsIteratingAndFormattingData/Exercises/ExercisesXP/exercisesxp.py`

### 🚀 Run

```bash
python Week1Python/Day2ListsIteratingAndFormattingData/Exercises/ExercisesXP/exercisesxp.py
```

### 🟢 What is already strong

- ✅ README documentation is generated and repeatable.
- ✅ Contains 1 source file(s) across practical exercises or projects.
- ✅ No Python syntax error was detected in this folder tree.
- ✅ A likely runnable entry point was detected.

### 🟠 What to improve next

- ⚠️ No local unit test is present yet; repository-wide syntax checks still cover the sources.

### 🧪 Validation

```bash
python tools/nova_quality_gate.py --repo . --strict
python -m unittest discover -s tests/python -p "test_*.py" -v
node tools/run_node_tests.mjs .
```

> The readiness value is a transparent repository heuristic, not a course grade and not proof that every interactive or external-API exercise was executed.

## ✅ What's inside (quick tour)

### 1) 💖 Favorite Numbers — *sets*
- Start with a set, add items, remove the temporary one with `.discard(...)`.
- Merge with friend’s favorites using `.union(...)` → `our_fav_numbers`.
- *🔍 Reminder:* sets are **unordered** and only keep **unique** elements.

### 2) 📦 Tuple — *immutability*
- `t = (1, 2, 3)` then `t = t + (4, 5)`.
- Tuples **cannot** be changed in place; concatenation returns a **new** tuple.

### 3) 📝 List Manipulation
- Remove items, append `"Kiwi"`, insert `"Apples"` at index `0`, count `Apples`, then `.clear()`.
- `.remove(x)` deletes the **first** match; lists keep **order**.

### 4) 🔢 Floats
- Build values from **1.5** to **5** stepping by **0.5**.
- If a step is whole (like `2.0`), cast to `int` so it prints `2` instead of `2.0`.
- Result: `[1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]`.

### 5) 🔄 For Loop
- Print numbers **1..20**.
- Then, with `enumerate(range(1, 21))`, print numbers where the **index is even** (`0,2,4,...`).  
  👉 Because `0` is the first index, this ends up printing the **odd numbers** `1,3,5,...,19`.

### 6) While Loop — Ask name until it matches
- Continues asking until input equals `"Kevin"` (case-insensitive, trims spaces).

### 7) Favorite Fruits
- Collect favorites as a **space-separated** string, split to a list, then check if a single fruit is in the list.
- Note: membership is **case-sensitive** as written.

### 8) Pizza Toppings
- Keep adding toppings until the user types `quit`.
- Price = **$10** base + **$2.5** per topping.

### 9) Cinemax Tickets
- Gather ages until `done`.
- Price rules: `<3 → $0`, `<=12 → $10`, `>12 → $15`.
- Bonus: build a list of **restricted** ages **16–21**.

### 10) Sandwich Orders
- Remove all `"Pastrami"` (sold out!), then prepare the rest FIFO, collecting them in `finished_sandwiches`.

## ▶️ How to run
### Option A — Double-click (if `.py` is associated with Python)
- Save as `exercisesxp.py` and double-click.

### Option B — Terminal / Command Prompt
```bash
# macOS / Linux
python3 exercisesxp.py

# Windows
python exercisesxp.py
# or
py exercisesxp.py
```
You’ll be prompted for input in several parts (Exercises **6–9**).

## 🧪 Tiny sample (trimmed)
```
our_fav_numbers: {1, 3, 7, 13, 27, 42}
tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
apples count: 2
final basket: []
sequence: [1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]
...
Sorry, no Pastrami today.
I made your Tuna sandwich.
I made your Avocado sandwich.
I made your Egg sandwich.
I made your Chicken sandwich.
Finished sandwiches: ['Tuna', 'Avocado', 'Egg', 'Chicken']
```
*(Set order may vary.)*

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**❌ Problem:** `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list`  
**✅ Solution:** Check if element exists before removing:
```python
if item in my_list:
    my_list.remove(item)
```

**❌ Problem:** Set order is unpredictable  
**✅ Solution:** Sets are unordered by design. Use lists if order matters.

**❌ Problem:** `TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment`  
**✅ Solution:** Tuples are immutable. Create a new tuple instead:
```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
t = t + (4, 5)  # Creates new tuple
```

**❌ Problem:** Pizza price calculation incorrect  
**✅ Solution:** Ensure base price + (topping count × topping price)

**❌ Problem:** Infinite while loop  
**✅ Solution:** Verify loop has proper exit condition and input validation

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Sets eliminate duplicates** - Perfect for finding unique values
2. **Tuples protect data** - Use for constants that shouldn't change
3. **enumerate() is powerful** - Get both index and value in loops
4. **Modular functions** - Break complex logic into helper functions
5. **Validate early** - Check user input before processing
