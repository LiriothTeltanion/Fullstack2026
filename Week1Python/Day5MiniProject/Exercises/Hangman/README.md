### Intelligent Masking

## 🎮 Game Rules```python

# Example: "credit card"

### Objective# Display: "****** ****"

Guess the hidden word/phrase before the gallows completes (6 wrong guesses).# After guessing 'c': "c***c* c***"

# After guessing 'r': "cr***c car*"

### Gameplay Flow```

1. **Computer picks** a random word/phrase from the word list

2. **Display shows** `*` for each letter; spaces and punctuation remain visible### Input Validation

3. **Player guesses** one letter at a time- Accepts only single alphabetic characters

4. **Correct guess**: All matching positions reveal the letter ✅- Rejects repeated guesses (doesn't count as wrong)

5. **Wrong guess**: A body part is added to the gallows (max 6 mistakes) ❌- Case-insensitive (converts all to lowercase)

6. **Repeated guess**: Not allowed - doesn't count as wrong

## 🧩 Example Words

### Win/Loss Conditions

- **🏆 Win**: Reveal all letters before 6 wrong guessesThe starter word list includes:

- **💀 Lose**: Complete the gallows (6 wrong guesses)- `correction`, `childish`, `beach`, `python`

- `assertive`, `interference`, `complete`

### Example Progression- `share`, `credit card`, `rush`, `south`

```

Round 1: Word: "******" → Guess 'p' → "p*****" ✅**Add more in `src/words.py`** to expand the game!

Round 2: Word: "p*****" → Guess 'y' → "py****" ✅

Round 3: Word: "py****" → Guess 'z' → "py****" ❌ (1 mistake)## 🔧 Troubleshooting

## 🏗️ Code Architecture## 🎓 Concepts Demonstrated



### Data Flow Diagram1. **Object-Oriented Programming**

```   - `HangmanGame` class encapsulating state and behavior

1. main.py calls random_word() from words.py   - Methods: `guess()`, `display()`, `is_won()`, `is_lost()`

        ↓

2. Creates HangmanGame instance with secret word2. **Modular Programming**

        ↓   - Separation of concerns (game logic, data, UI)

3. Game loop: prompt user → guess() → update state   - Clean imports between modules

        ↓

4. Display: gallows() from art.py + masked() from game.py3. **State Management**

        ↓   - Tracking guessed letters with `Set[str]`

5. Check: is_won() or is_lost()   - Wrong attempt counter

        ↓   - Win/loss conditions

6. End game or continue loop

        ↓4. **String Manipulation**

7. Ask play again? → Repeat or exit   - Character masking with `*`

```   - Case normalization

   - Letter detection with `isalpha()`

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. Modular Design
Each file has a single, clear responsibility:

- **`game.py`**: Contains `HangmanGame` class managing game state
  - Tracks guessed letters, wrong attempts, masked display
  - Only letters are maskable; spaces/punctuation show as-is
  
- **`words.py`**: Word source with `random_word()` function
  - Starter list: `correction`, `python`, `credit card`, `south`, etc.
  - Easy to expand with more words/phrases
  
- **`art.py`**: ASCII art for visual feedback
  - 7 gallows stages (0-6 wrong guesses)
  - Defines `MAX_WRONG = 6` constant

### 2. Intelligent Masking

The game smartly handles different character types:

```python
# Example: "credit card"
Initial:         "****** ****"
After 'c':       "c***c* c***"
After 'r':       "cr***c car*"
After 'd':       "cr*d*c card"
After 'e':       "cred*c card"
After 'i':       "credi* card"
After 't':       "credit card" ✅ WIN!
```

**Key Logic:**
- Letters → Masked as `*` until guessed
- Spaces → Always visible
- Punctuation → Always visible
- Case-insensitive → All converted to lowercase

### 3. Input Validation

Robust validation prevents errors:

```python
# Validation Rules
✅ Accept: Single letter (a-z or A-Z)
❌ Reject: Numbers, symbols, multiple characters
❌ Reject: Empty input
❌ Reject: Already guessed letters (shows message, no penalty)

# Examples
"a" → ✅ Valid
"A" → ✅ Valid (converted to lowercase)
"ab" → ❌ "Please enter a single letter"
"1" → ❌ "Please enter a single letter"
"" → ❌ "Please enter a single letter"
"a" (again) → ⚠️ "Already guessed, try different letter"
```

### 4. State Machine Pattern

The game uses a state machine to track progress:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   PLAYING   │ ← Initial state
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ├─── Guess correct? → Update masked word
      │                      └─ All revealed? → WON state
      │
      └─── Guess wrong? → Increment wrong counter
                           └─ wrong >= 6? → LOST state
```

---

## 🧩 Example Words

The starter word list includes:
- **Single words**: `correction`, `childish`, `beach`, `python`, `assertive`, `interference`, `complete`, `share`, `rush`, `south`
- **Phrases**: `credit card` (space visible during gameplay)

**Add more words in `src/words.py`**:
```python
WORD_LIST = [
    "correction",
    "python",
    "credit card",
    # Add your own words/phrases here!
    "machine learning",
    "artificial intelligence",
    "programming",
]
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

Test the game with these scenarios:

#### Normal Gameplay
- [ ] Start game and see masked word
- [ ] Guess correct letter → letter reveals
- [ ] Guess wrong letter → gallows updates
- [ ] Complete word → win message
- [ ] 6 wrong guesses → lose message

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Guess already-guessed letter → warning message, no penalty
- [ ] Word with spaces (e.g., "credit card") → spaces visible
- [ ] Capital letter input → converts to lowercase, works correctly
- [ ] Win with 0 mistakes → perfect score
- [ ] Lose on 6th mistake → game ends correctly

#### Invalid Input
- [ ] Enter number → error message
- [ ] Enter multiple letters → error message
- [ ] Enter symbol → error message
- [ ] Empty input → error message

### Test Inputs

| Input | Expected Behavior | What It Tests |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| `p` (correct) | Letter reveals, lives stay same | Normal hit |
| `z` (wrong) | Gallows updates, lives decrease | Normal miss |
| `p` (repeat) | Warning message, no penalty | Repeat detection |
| `P` (uppercase) | Works same as `p` | Case handling |
| `abc` | Error message | Multi-char validation |
| `5` | Error message | Non-letter validation |
| `` (empty) | Error message | Empty input handling |

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Import Errors
**Symptom**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`

**Cause**: Running from wrong directory

**Solution**:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the Hangman directory
cd Exercises/Hangman
python main.py
```

#### Issue 2: ASCII Art Not Displaying Properly
**Symptom**: Gallows looks broken or misaligned

**Cause**: Terminal encoding issues

**Solution**: 
- Use a terminal with UTF-8 support
- Try different terminal (Windows Terminal, iTerm2, etc.)

#### Issue 3: "No Guesses Left" Immediately
**Symptom**: Game starts with 0 lives

**Cause**: `MAX_WRONG` constant issue

**Solution**: Check `src/art.py` has `MAX_WRONG = 6`

#### Issue 4: Repeated Guess Still Counts as Wrong
**Symptom**: Guessing same letter twice adds to wrong count

**Cause**: Logic error in `game.py`

**Solution**: Verify `if ch in self.guessed: return 'repeat'` comes BEFORE incrementing `self.wrong`

---

## 🎓 Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming
```python
class HangmanGame:
    def __init__(self, secret: str):
        self.secret = secret.lower()
        self.guessed: Set[str] = set()
        self.wrong = 0
```
**Learning**: Encapsulation of state and behavior

### 2. Type Hints
```python
def guess(self, ch: str) -> str:
    """Return 'hit', 'miss', or 'repeat'"""
```
**Learning**: Clear function contracts and better IDE support

### 3. Set Data Structure
```python
self.guessed: Set[str] = set()
if ch in self.guessed:  # O(1) lookup!
    return 'repeat'
```
**Learning**: Efficient membership testing

### 4. String Manipulation
```python
def masked(self) -> str:
    return ''.join(
        ch if ch in self.guessed else '*'
        if ch.isalpha() else ch
        for ch in self.secret
    )
```
**Learning**: List comprehension, conditional expressions

### 5. Modular Programming
```
main.py → game.py (logic)
       → words.py (data)
       → art.py (display)
```
**Learning**: Separation of concerns, maintainability
