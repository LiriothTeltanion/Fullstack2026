## 🏗️ Project Architecture Lessons

### 📐 Tic-Tac-Toe Structure (MVC Pattern)

```
📦 tictactoe.py
│
├─ 🧠 GAME LOGIC (Model)
│  ├─ new_board() → [[" "]*3, [" "]*3, [" "]*3]
│  │     Creates empty 3x3 board
│  │
│  ├─ check_win(board, player) → bool
│  │     Checks rows, columns, diagonals
│  │
│  └─ is_tie(board) → bool
│        Checks if board is full
│
├─ 🖥️ DISPLAY (View)
│  └─ display_board(board) → None
│        Renders board to console with formatting
│
└─ 🎮 USER INTERACTION (Controller)
   ├─ player_input(board, player) → (row, col)
   │     Gets and validates move from user
   │
   ├─ parse_move(input) → (row, col)
   │     Converts "2 3" to (1, 2)
   │
   ├─ validate_move(board, input) → (row, col)
   │     Checks if move is legal
   │
   └─ play() → None
         Main game loop orchestration

Benefits of this structure:
✅ Separation of concerns
✅ Easy to test individual components
✅ Clear responsibility boundaries
✅ Simple to add features (AI, replay, etc.)
```

### 🎪 Hangman Modular Design

```
📦 hangman/
│
├─ 📁 src/
│  │
│  ├─ 📄 game.py (Business Logic)
│  │  └─ HangmanGame class
│  │     ├─ __init__(word)
│  │     ├─ guess_letter(letter) → bool
│  │     ├─ is_won() → bool
│  │     ├─ is_lost() → bool
│  │     └─ get_display_word() → str
│  │
│  ├─ 📄 words.py (Data Layer)
│  │  ├─ WORD_LIST = [...]
│  │  └─ get_random_word() → str
│  │
│  └─ 📄 art.py (Presentation Layer)
│     └─ HANGMAN_STAGES = [...]
│         Returns ASCII art for each stage
│
└─ 📄 main.py (Entry Point)
   └─ Main game loop
      ├─ Create game instance
      ├─ Display current state
      ├─ Get user input
      ├─ Update game state
      └─ Check win/loss conditions

Architecture Benefits:
✅ Each file has single responsibility
✅ Easy to add new word categories
✅ Simple to change ASCII art
✅ Game logic independent of display
✅ Can reuse components in other projects
```

## 🎓 Key Takeaways & Skills Integration

### What You've Learned This Week

| Week 1 Concept | Where You Used It | Why It Matters |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Variables** | Board state, player names, scores | Storing and tracking data |
| **Conditionals** | Win checking, input validation | Decision making logic |
| **Loops** | Game loops, input retry | Repetitive tasks & iteration |
| **Lists** | Board grid, word letters, guesses | Dynamic data collections |
| **Dictionaries** | *Not used yet - see challenges!* | Key-value data management |
| **Functions** | Every game action | Code organization & reuse |
| **Strings** | Word display, user messages | Text manipulation |
| **Input/Output** | User interaction, game display | User experience |
| **Error Handling** | Invalid moves, bad input | Robust applications |

### 🎯 Professional Coding Patterns You've Applied

1. **Input Validation Loop**
   ```python
   while True:
       try:
           # Get and validate input
           break  # Exit on success
       except ValueError:
           # Show error and retry
   ```

2. **Game State Management**
   ```python
   board = new_board()  # Initialize
   while not game_over:
       display_board(board)  # Show state
       move = get_input()    # Get action
       update_board(move)    # Update state
       check_conditions()    # Evaluate
   ```

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Data (board, words)
   - Logic (win checking, validation)
   - Display (rendering, formatting)
   - Control (game loop, flow)

- **Comments**: Explain complex logic and function purposes
- **Error Handling**: Validate user input and handle edge cases

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Project Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Logic errors in game rules | Step through code manually with test cases |
| Input validation failing | Test with various input types and edge cases |
| Code becoming too complex | Break large functions into smaller ones |
| Hard to track game state | Use clear variable names and add debug prints |

### 💡 Success Strategies
- **🐌 Start simple**: Get basic version working first
- **🔍 Debug systematically**: Use print statements to track values
- **📚 Reference previous days**: Apply patterns from earlier exercises  
- **🤝 Ask for help**: Don't hesitate to seek guidance when stuck

## �🐛 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error 1: Infinite game loops
**What it means**: Game never ends due to incorrect loop condition

**Example**:
```python
❌ while True:
       # Game logic
       if someone_won():
           print("Winner!")
           # Forgot to break!

✅ game_over = False
   while not game_over:
       # Game logic
       if someone_won() or board_full():
           game_over = True  # Exit loop
```

### Error 2: Not validating user input in games
**What it means**: Assuming user always enters valid data

**Example**:
```python
❌ row, col = input("Enter row col: ").split()
   row = int(row)  # ValueError if user enters text!

✅ try:
       row, col = input("Enter row col: ").split()
       row, col = int(row), int(col)
       if not (1 <= row <= 3 and 1 <= col <= 3):
           print("Must be 1-3!")
   except ValueError:
       print("Enter two numbers separated by space!")
```

### Error 3: Modifying game state incorrectly
**What it means**: Not checking if move is valid before applying

**Example**:
```python
❌ def make_move(board, row, col, player):
       board[row][col] = player  # Overwrites existing moves!

✅ def make_move(board, row, col, player):
       if board[row][col] == " ":  # Check if empty
           board[row][col] = player
           return True
       print("Cell already taken!")
       return False
```

### Error 4: Not handling edge cases in win detection
**What it means**: Missing diagonal checks or off-by-one errors

**Example**:
```python
❌ # Missing diagonal check
   def check_winner(board):
       # Only checks rows and columns
       for i in range(3):
           if all(board[i]):  # Incomplete logic
               return True

✅ def check_winner(board, player):
       # Check rows
       for row in board:
           if all(cell == player for cell in row):
               return True
       # Check columns
       for col in range(3):
           if all(board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)):
               return True
       # Check diagonals
       if all(board[i][i] == player for i in range(3)):
           return True
       if all(board[i][2-i] == player for i in range(3)):
           return True
       return False
```

### Error 5: File handling errors in Hangman
**What it means**: Not handling missing or empty word files

**Example**:
```python
❌ def load_words():
       with open("words.txt") as f:
           return f.read().split()  # FileNotFoundError if missing!

✅ def load_words():
       try:
           with open("words.txt") as f:
               words = [w.strip() for w in f if w.strip()]
               if not words:
                   print("Word file is empty!")
                   return ["python", "developer"]  # Fallback
               return words
       except FileNotFoundError:
           print("words.txt not found, using defaults")
           return ["python", "developer", "function"]
```

### Error 6: Not resetting game state between rounds
**What it means**: Previous game data carries over to new game

**Example**:
```python
❌ guessed_letters = []  # Global variable
   
   def play_game():
       # Uses same guessed_letters from last game!
       
✅ def play_game():
       guessed_letters = []  # Fresh state each game
       # Rest of game logic
       
✅ # Or reset explicitly
   def reset_game():
       global guessed_letters
       guessed_letters = []
```

### Error 7: String comparison case sensitivity
**What it means**: Not handling uppercase/lowercase input consistently

**Example**:
```python
❌ word = "PYTHON"
   guess = input("Guess a letter: ")  # User types "p"
   if guess in word:  # False! "p" != "P"

✅ word = "PYTHON"
   guess = input("Guess a letter: ").upper()
   if guess in word:  # Now works!

✅ # Or normalize everything
   word = "python".lower()
   guess = input("Guess: ").lower()
```

### Error 8: Not tracking game statistics properly
**What it means**: Counters or scores not updating correctly

**Example**:
```python
❌ def update_score(score):
       score += 10  # Only modifies local copy!
       
   player_score = 0
   update_score(player_score)
   # player_score still 0!

✅ def update_score(score):
       return score + 10
   
   player_score = update_score(player_score)

✅ # Or use mutable object
   stats = {"score": 0, "wins": 0}
   def update_score(stats):
       stats["score"] += 10  # Modifies original dict
```
